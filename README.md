# Circuit 3D
Circuit 3d allows to design 3D printed boards for simple electronic circuits. It is coded in Processing language.
A 3D file can be generate and the OPENSCAD software can be used to obtain a stl file for the 3D printer.

## Help

- NEW : generate a new design (board with 4 holes).
- SIZE : change the size of the board in mm.
- ADD : add components. The component files are txt files. Select components and deplace them with the mouse. 
- SUP : suppress the selected component
- TEXT : Add  text at the clicked position of the mouse
- WIRE : Add wires. This wires will not be printed but can be used as an help to connect the components.
- GEN : generate the OPENSCAD file
- SAVE : save the circuit in a file
- LOAD : load a circuit
- QUIT : quit the software
